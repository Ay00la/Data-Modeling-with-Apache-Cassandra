Cassandra Project


Making a `requirements.txt` file if you want others to use your project
`pip3 freeze requirements.txt.`

- I did this in a virtual env so that only the packages for the project would be installed.

You could install those packages with
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
I don’t do this enough but it’s good practice and I need to start doing this more on a project by project basis. 

I’m starting to do all my projects in their own virtual environment so that package dependencies do not conflict. I would look into `venv`

- some people like `conda` but I am not a fan because I have faced dependency issues in that past so decicded to stay away.

I liked how you checked for the ‘’ (blank values) in the first column when writing the values of the list to the new file (a form of testing)


Could be improved:
query: `copy_music_session`

What I would do moving forward:

- instead of going row by row in the csv, a copy command would bulk insert all the rows
- the only problem I have run into is the copy command as the python cql driver does not support that → I would suggest figuring out how to do this. I’ve done it in postgres but not cassandra


- One thing I did not work on was shutting down the cluster, but I do shut down the connection so maybe that inherently shuts down the cluster?
